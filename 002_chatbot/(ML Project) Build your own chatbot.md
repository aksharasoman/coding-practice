It is fun to build.

### Key Aspects
- **Training**: LLMs have 2 phases of training.
	- Pre-training: a model is trained to predict the next word
	- Fine-tuning: tunes a model to a particular task.
		- For chat models: task is *Conversational*
- **Memory**
	- To remember turns of a conversation, we can add memory
		- LLM does not have memory on its own.
- **Production**
	- Needs to be monitored to ensure safe and non-toxic conversations.
