It is fun to build.

### Background
[[Key Aspects of Building a Chatbot.md]]
[[deeplearning.ai Courses for developing a chatbot]]

### Implementation - Aspects to Consider
1. OpenAI API key used in deeplearning.ai course is not free. Hence, instead of openai, use a free LLM API - 
	1. [[Gemini LLM API key]] : free-tier option available
	2. Another option: [Llama API](https://docs.llama-api.com/quickstart) free in its beta version (now: jul 2024)::  [Obtaining an API Token - Llama API](https://docs.llama-api.com/api-token) 
3. Using [panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/index.html) python library to build chat GUI 

Egs: [barista bot](https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts/barista-bot)

### Objective
Build a chatbot for a pizzeria for taking orders using Gemini 1.5 Flash model and build GUI using "Panel" library
#### Tasks:
1. 

###### Followup queries:
1. Llama model vs gemini - performance comparison for conversational tasks
2. Any other chatbot application related to my life : book suggestion bot?? (tough)
