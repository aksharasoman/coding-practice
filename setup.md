2 local folders (macbook) for 'coding-practice':
1. Notes & script files:
	Location: /Users/aksharas/2.Projects/*obsidian_ml_projects/000_coding-practice*

Git updating guidelines: 
	- Parent folder 'obsidian_ml_projects' is synced to the github repo 'https://github.com/aksharasoman/notes_ml_projects.git' & will be reflected with updates made from the corresponding obsidian vault. 
	- Child folder: '000_coding-practice'
		I can keep the script files in appropriate subfolders inside this child folder.
		This child folder is mapped to another repository: 'https://github.com/aksharasoman/coding-practice.git'
		Regular push/pull changes are reflected only in the parent repository.
		When I'm want to update the child repository, run the following command:
		
		
1. webpage files: /Users/aksharas/2.Projects/webpage_github/quartoFiles/posts/coding-practice
- Copied files required to update in the webpage to this folder: readme.md as index.qmd & questions_list.qmd 
- 'questions_list.qmd' needs to be regularly updated as 'questions_list.md' file gets updated in the script folder.
